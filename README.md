# About the project:

 1. There are two players, Player 1 and Player 2.
 2. The players take turns making a move until either one of them wins the game, or else the board is filled up without either player winning.
 3. Both Player 1 and Player 2 work on the same, shared game board: in a real game-playing session, the players would need to pass the computer mouse back and forth between each other.
 4. On each turn, a player clicks on one of the available buttons. That button will change its background colour to indicate that it has been selected, and will also change its text to indicate which player has chosen it (either “1” or “2”)
 5. Once a button has been clicked by one of the players, it is unavailable to be clicked any more.
 6. A player wins if they select all buttons in a 2x2 square.
 7. The “Reset” button at the bottom can be used at any time to restore the grid to its original state, with no squares claimed.

# How to use:
Simply, just run `GameWindow.java` as an application using either:

 1. Command line:

	`javac GameWindow.java && java GameWindow.java`

2. IDE.

# What did I learn from this:

 1. Making GUI applications in Java using Swing.
 2. Designing Java classes and methods based on low detailed specification.
 3. Further improved my decision-making and problem-solving skills.
